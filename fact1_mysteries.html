                <h1>mysteries</h1>
                <ol>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Thonis-Heracleion</h3><br>An Egyptian port city on the Mediterranean Sea, Thonis-Heracleion served as a major trading hub prior to the founding of nearby Alexandria around 331 B.C. Mythical hero Heracles and Helen of Troy both supposedly spent time there. Around the second century B.C., however, the city center collapsed due to soil liquification, possibly triggered by earthquakes, tsunamis, or floods. Eventually, all of Thonis-Heracleion sank underwater, where it remained lost to time until being rediscovered in the early 2000s by marine archeologists. Since then, large statues, animal sarcophagi, temple ruins, pottery shards, jewelry, coins, and even 2,400-year-old fruit baskets have been pulled from the waves, thus shining new light on this real-life Atlantis.</li>
                   <li><h3>Plain of Jars</h3><br>Thousands of lichen-covered stone jars from the Iron Age, some standing close to 10 feet tall and weighing several tons, dot the mountainous landscape of northern Laos. Carved largely from sandstone and found in groups ranging from just one to 400, legend holds that giants used them as wine glasses. Many archeologists, on the other hand, believe they served as funerary urns, though much remains unknown about their purpose, about how they were moved into place, and about the civilization that produced them. Recent research dates at least some of the stone jars to as early as 1240 B.C., which would make them far older than the human remains buried nearby. Complicating matters is that many of the jars stand in fields of unexploded munitions, the vestige of a massive U.S. bombing campaign during the Vietnam War, and therefore cannot be safely studied.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Guanabara Bay</h3><br>Acting on a tip from locals, controversial shipwreck explorer Robert Marx claimed in 1982 to have discovered a number of twin-handled Roman vases, known as amphoras, in Brazil’s Guanabara Bay. According to Marx, the barnacle-covered amphoras provided proof that the Romans were the first Europeans in Brazil, having pre-dated the Portuguese by over 1,000 years. However, he was never able to fully explore the site, as the Brazilian government banned him from the country for alleged looting and halted underwater exploration altogether. Marx responded by accusing Brazil’s Navy of dumping sediment on the amphoras so as not to have to re-write history. To this day, a Roman presence on Brazil’s coast remains highly unproven.</li>
                   <li><h3>Nazca Lines</h3><br>Roughly 2,000 years ago, a pre-Inca civilization etched a series of enormous drawings into the dry coastal plain of Peru. Known as the Nazca Lines, these geoglyphs remained largely unknown until aircraft began flying over the area in the 1930s. To date, well over 1,000 designs have been located: Most are straight lines, stretching up to 30 miles, or geometric shapes, from trapezoids to spirals, while others depict animals and plants, including a spider, a hummingbird, a monkey, a whale, a two-headed snake, a dog, and a humanoid figure nicknamed “The Astronaut.” As recently as 2022, 168 new geoglyphs were discovered, yet researchers still don’t understand their purpose. One prominent hypothesis associates them with water rituals, though other guesses abound as well.</li>
                   <img src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2016/10/gettyimages-106525203.jpg?width=1080&height=720&crop=1080%3A720%2Csmart&quality=75" alt="">
                   <li class="color"><h3>Paracas Candelabra</h3><br>To the northwest of the Nazca Lines, carved into a hillside overlooking Peru’s Pisco Bay, lies the Paracas Candelabra, another massive geoglyph that stretches some 600 feet from top to bottom. Though pottery found at the site has been dated to around 200 B.C., no one knows the age of the candelabra itself. Its raison d’être remains equally fuzzy. One theory holds that it served as a navigational tool for sailors, whereas another claims it depicted the creator god’s trident.</li>
                   <img src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/Paracas-Candelabra-GettyImages-1404539378.jpg?width=1080&height=608&crop=1080%3A608%2Csmart&quality=75" alt="">
                   <li><h3>Sacsayhuamán</h3><br>Elsewhere in Peru, just outside Cuzco, stands the remains of the Sacsayhuamán fortress, which was painstakingly constructed by the Incas in the 1400s. Much like at Machu Picchu, Inca laborers somehow moved enormous rocks into place—some of which weighed 125 tons or more—before masons cut them, using only bronze and stone tools, and fitted them together without mortar. Though Spanish colonizers dismantled much of the site for building materials, Sacsayhuamán has remained structurally sound enough to withstand large earthquakes and other ravages of time.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Cleopatra's Tomb</h3><br>For an ancient ruler, much is known about Cleopatra VII, the so-called last queen of Egypt, who famously consorted with both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony and later committed suicide in 30 B.C. following Antony’s and her defeat at the Battle of Actium. Yet the location of Antony’s and her tomb—the couple were purportedly buried together—remains a complete mystery. Some researchers believe it resided in Alexandria, her capital city and the one-time cultural center of the Mediterranean world, only to be lost when a tsunami swept through in 365 A.D. Others suspect elsewhere in the Nile Delta, possibly in a temple dedicated to Isis and Osiris, the gods with which Cleopatra and Antony respectively associated themselves. In addition to Cleopatra’s, other legendary lost burial sites include those of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan. </li>
                   <li><h3>Voynich Manuscript</h3><br>In 1912, rare book dealer Wilfrid Voynich acquired a medieval manuscript that he claimed had been housed in “an ancient castle in southern Europe.” Written in an extinct language, or code, no one could recognize and filled with strange illustrations of fictitious plants and naked women, it has befuddled scholars ever since, including Alan Turing and the FBI, both of whom tried and failed to crack the case. Over the years, several people have professed to decipher it, but each time have been greeted with a massive chorus of doubts. Some suspect the whole thing is an elaborate hoax. Now housed at Yale University, the Voynich manuscript is available to the public for anyone interested in trying to solve the puzzle once and for all.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Yonaguni Monument</h3><br>Off the coast of Japan’s Yonaguni Island lies an underwater rock structure, at least 165 feet long and 65 feet wide, that resembles a manmade step pyramid. Discovered in the 1980s and now known as the Yonaguni Monument, it is believed by some researchers to be the ruins of an ancient civilization. Many other researchers, however, contend that “Japan’s Atlantis” is nothing more than a curious natural phenomenon shaped by tectonic uplift and ocean currents.</li>
                   <img src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2023/03/yonaguni-Island-GettyImages-594183743.jpg?width=1080&height=608&crop=1080%3A608%2Csmart&quality=75" alt="">
                   <li><h3> Stonehenge</h3><br>Construction of Stonehenge, one of the world’s most iconic prehistoric landmarks, began some 5,000 years ago, before England even entered the Bronze Age. Well studied for centuries, most researchers agree it functioned as a burial site—and it’s now known where the massive stones came from. Yet Stonehenge’s other secrets remain stubbornly elusive, involving its possible religious, ceremonial, astronomical, and therapeutic significance.</li>
                   <img src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2018/07/germanys-stonehenge-gettyimages-630339420.jpg?width=1080&height=608&crop=1080%3A608%2Csmart&quality=75" alt="">
                   <li class="color"><h3>Machu Picchu, Peru</h3><br>Set amid misty Andean peaks, Machu Picchu is believed to have been built in the 15th century by Inca ruler Pachacutec. The sprawling stone complex is made up of hundreds of buildings—palaces, temples, baths, and more—as well as an intricate water-delivery system. The fact that Machu Picchu was constructed without the use of the wheel, metal tools, or mortar is a marvel in itself, though the question that continues to perplex historians is why it was built—and then abandoned. A popular theory is that this mountaintop citadel served as a retreat for Inca royalty, and then collapsed soon after Spanish conquistadores arrived on South American soil. But the site’s history is still open to debate.</li>
                   <img src="https://static.nationalgeographic.es/files/expeditions.jpg?url=https://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/machu-picchu-peru-shutterstock-1387848629-1446x800.jpg" alt="">
                   <li><h3>Skara Brae, Scotland</h3><br>The ancient stone village of Skara Brae stands on a mossy, windswept coast in Scotland’s Orkney Islands. Settled about 5,000 years ago, Skara Brae predates both Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza, and is one of the best-preserved Neolithic sites in Europe. It consists of a series of stone homes where nearly everything—except for the roofing—remains intact, from stone beds and dressers to Scotland’s earliest-known toilet. This once-thriving community of farmers, hunters, and artisans was mysteriously abandoned around 2500 BC. The absence of human remains or evidence pointing towards warfare begs the question: what prompted Skara Brae’s residents to just up and leave?</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>The Great Sphinx of Giza, Egypt</h3><br>Egypt’s ancient monuments have always evoked an irresistible sense of wonder, but none more so than the enigmatic Sphinx. Located on the Giza Plateau on the banks of the Nile River, this monumental limestone statue is the largest monolithic statue in the world, measuring 240 feet long and 66 feet high. It represents a mythical creature of Egyptian invention—half-lion, half-human—which later found its way into Greek mythology. Believed to have been built during the reign of the pharaoh Khafre in the 3rd millennium BC to guard his pyramid tomb, some historians suggest that the Sphinx might date back 9,000 years. The Sphinx, it seems, is not quite ready to divulge its secrets.</li>
                   <img src="https://static.nationalgeographic.es/files/expeditions.jpg?url=https://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-great-sphinx-of-giza-egypt-shutterstock-598116131-1200x800.jpg" alt="">
                   <li><h3>Angkor, Cambodia</h3><br>Hidden in the depths of the Cambodian jungle, the sacred city of Angkor was the capital of the Khmer Empire from the 9th to the 15th century. It was established by Hindu king Jayavarman II and grew to become the largest urban complex of the preindustrial world, with a population numbering nearly one million. Today, Angkor is a maze of vine-covered temples, larger-than-life sculptures, and beautiful courtyards shaded by towering banyan trees; it also harbours the remains of a complex hydrological system, once the lifeline of the city. While there is no firmly established explanation for Angkor’s downfall, recent research shows that climate change might have been responsible.</li>
                   <img src="https://static.nationalgeographic.es/files/expeditions.jpg?url=https://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/angkor-cambodia-shutterstock-247116484-1422x800.jpg" alt="">
                   <li class="color"><h3>Easter Island, Chile</h3><br>One of the world’s most enduring mysteries, Easter Island continues to perplex visitors and experts alike. This remote Pacific island—some 2,200 miles from the nearest continent—was once home to a prosperous Polynesian community. Why or when the first settlers arrived here remains unknown, and how their civilization collapsed is a topic of heated debate. The more intriguing mystery, however, surrounds the gigantic stone statues, or moai, that the island is famous for. Believed to have been built between 1200 and 1650 AD without the use of wheels or large animals, there are about 900 statues scattered throughout the island. Were these enigmatic stone visages created to honour ancestors or chiefs, as most scholars suspect? Or did they serve another purpose?</li>
                   <li><h3>Ggantija Temples, Malta</h3><br>The Ggantija Temples are located on the Maltese island of Gozo, in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. These massive megaliths are estimated to be some 5,500 years old, making them the oldest site on this list. Local legend holds that they were built by a race of giants; hence the name Ggantija, which derives from the Maltese word for “giant.” Archaeologists speculate that the temples might have been devoted to an ancient fertility cult, though what truly astounds the visitor is how these freestanding limestone structures—some of them rising to nearly 20 feet—were erected using nothing but basic stone tools.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Tikal, Guatemala</h3><br>Tikal is home to the ruins of a powerful Maya city that flourished from around AD 300 to 800. Nestled in the depths of the Guatemalan rainforest, this magnificent settlement was once inhabited by more than 60,000 people and covered an area of at least 47 square miles, making it one of the largest pre-Columbian cities. Among Tikal’s unearthed structures are palaces, step-pyramid temples, and ball courts. Though a wealth of information about the city has been decoded from stelae—monoliths covered in hieroglyphs—archaeologists still don’t have any clues as to the cause of Tikal’s decline. Was it drought, disease, war—or something else altogether?</li>
                   <img src="https://static.nationalgeographic.es/files/expeditions.jpg?url=https://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tikal-guatemala-shutterstock-1412568428-1446x800.jpg" alt="">
                   <li><h3>Nasca Lines, Peru</h3><br>Dating between 200 BC and 600 AD, the Nasca Lines are geoglyphs—enormous drawings on the ground—located in southern Peru. They are believed to have been created by the prehistoric Nasca people, who flourished in the region at the time. Numbering more than 1,000, the drawings depict straight lines, geometric figures, animals, and plants—including a monkey, hummingbird, lizard, and orca. With the benefit of modern air transport, we can see that these vast, well-defined patterns are best viewed from the sky; but did the ancient Nasca ever enjoy that perspective to admire their finished work? More importantly, what purpose did the drawings serve? Some theories attribute them astronomical significance, while others link them to water and fertility rites. They might have even been messages to celestial beings—gods or otherwise.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Terra-Cotta Army, China</h3><br>In the mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang Di, China’s first emperor, an army of 8,000 life-sized statues stands guard—generals, soldiers, archers, cavalry, and more. This incredible funerary contingent—the likes of which have not been found anywhere else in the world—forms but a part of the vast necropolis that Emperor Qin commissioned in the 3rd century BC to serve as his eternal home. Qin’s tomb is yet to be excavated; according to ancient accounts, it contains innumerable treasures, replicas of palaces, even lethal booby traps. What other wonders might the terra-cotta warriors be protecting?</li>
                   <img src="https://static.nationalgeographic.es/files/expeditions.jpg?url=https://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/terra-cotta-army-china-shutterstock-187374500-1200x800.jpg" alt="">
                   <li><h3>Chichén Itzá, Mexico</h3><br>One of Central America’s most spectacular ancient cities, Chichén Itzá was founded around the 6th century AD by the Maya people of the Yucatán Peninsula. At its peak, it was a thriving metropolis of up to 50,000 people: there were stately homes where the city’s elite might have lived, and an observatory, where skilled astronomers followed the movements of Venus. Chichén Itzá also harbours a variety of step pyramids, as well as the largest ball court in the region; here, the losing team’s captain—and sometimes the entire team—was sacrificed to the gods. What became of this extraordinary culture? Perhaps it was internal warfare that spelt its doom; overpopulation, deforestation, or drought. We might never know.</li>
                   <img src="https://static.nationalgeographic.es/files/expeditions.jpg?url=https://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chichen-itza-mexico-shutterstock-161210453-1200x800.jpg" alt="">
                   <li class="color"><h3>Bermuda Triangle</h3><br>It’s a mysterious area where over the past 500 years, airplanes and ships have gone mysteriously missing. Reason why it’s called the Bermuda (or Devil's) Triangle. This area is bounded by the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda; Florida, Miami, United States; and the American territory of Puerto Rico. A lot of theories have been floated by scientists and experts, such as from unidentified flying objects (UFOs) to sea monsters, yet nobody has been able to decode the mystery.</li>
                   <li><h3>Scotland - Loch Ness monster</h3><br>Do you think a monster like Loss Ness exist? Well, as per the legends, it’s a mythical aquatic creature that can be found in Scotland, while some experts opine that it’s large animal that represents a line of dinosaurs. The first photographic evidence of the monster was believed to be found in 1934, which was later found to be a fake in 1994. In 2008, there were reports that the creature might have become extinct due to global warming, while in the recent times[, scientists are in talks to use environmental DNA to establish the existence of the said monster.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>England - Shugborough inscription</h3><br>This 18th-century Shepherd's Monument in Staffordshire, England, looks like and normal monument from afar, but if one gets closer, they will notice a curious sequence of letters: DOUOSVAVVM — which is a code that has remained unresolved for all these years. Some experts speculated that the code could likely be a clue that has been left behind by the Knights Templar regarding the whereabouts of Holy Grail, other have tried to crack the code, but all in vain.</li>
                   <li><h3>Italy - Shroud of Turin</h3><br>It’s a piece of linen cloth that bears the image of a man, which is believed to be Jesus of Nazareth’s burial shroud. As per the records, it has been kept in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. What’s interesting to note is that over the years, many scientists have studied the cloth, and carried out a range of tests, including DNA studies. As per one study that was published in July 2018, the shroud is fake as the bloodstain patterns seemed to be unrealistic. Nevertheless, the shroud still remains a religious icon, but shrouded with mystery.</li>
                   <li class="color"><h3>Pakistan - Mohenjo Daro</h3><br>It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was built around 2500 BC. It was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation, and was one of the world's earliest cities. This site thrived along the fertile plains of the Indus River, until it collapsed mysteriously. This city remained unknown till 1911, when archaeologists made their first discovery. Interesting thing to note is that the fate of the civilisation and people here still remains unknown, although many theories have been put forward by experts.</li>
