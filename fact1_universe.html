                   <li>The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus.</li>
                   <li class="color">The Sun is just one of hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy that we live in, which is called the Milky Way. The whole Universe has at least 100 billion galaxies in it.</li>

                   <li class="color">THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE IS MUCH HOTTER THAN THE SUN'S SURFACE</li>
                   <li> SATURN HAS A HEXAGONAL-SHAPED STORM</li>
                   <li class="color">ORGANICS MOLECULES ARE EVERYWHERE</li>
                   <li> Pluto is smaller in diameter than the U.S. </li>

                   <li>There are Mars rocks on Earth (and we didn’t bring them here).</li>
                   <li class="color">Jupiter has the biggest ocean of any planet</li>
                   <li> Even really small bodies can have moons.</li>
                   <li class="color">The sun is a star at the center of the solar system</li>
                   <h4>moon</h4>
                   <li>The moon is about 384,400 kilometers away from Earth</li>
                   <li class="color">The moon's surface is constantly bombarded by meteoroids</li>
                   <li>The moon has no atmosphere or magnetic field</li>
                   <li class="color">The moon's surface has been explored by 12 astronauts.</li>

                   <h4>comets and Asteroids</h4>
                   <li>As comets get close to the sun, they start to "melt" and release gas and dust</li>
                   <li class="color">Comets are often called "dirty snowballs"</li>
                   <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRvZ-k4WxM77mVnZW1APPrfepwjnZvamt-hTQ&usqp=CAU" alt="">
                   <li>Asteroids are made mostly of rock and metal</li>
                   <h4>mercury</h4>
                   <li class="color">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system – only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. </li>
                   <li>Mercury is the planet that orbits the closest to the Sun.</li>
                   <li class="color">Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system.</li>
                   <li>Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</li>
                   <li class="color">Mercury has no moons.</li>
                   <li>There are no rings around Mercury. </li>
                   <li class="color">Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star would appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.</li>

                   <h4>venus</h4>
                   <li>A day on Venus is longer than a year</li>
                   <li class="color">Unlike the other planets in our solar system, Venus spins clockwise on its axis</li>
                   <li> Venus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon</li>
                   <li class="color"> Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty</li>
                   <li>Venus rotates backward on its axis compared to most planets in our solar system. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite of what we see on Earth.</li>
                   <li class="color">Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid that start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles (45 to 70 kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!</li>

                   <h4>mars</h4>
                   <li class="color">Named after the Roman God of war, Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system.</li>
                   <li> Mars is also known as the ‘Red Planet’ because, well, it’s red! This signature colour comes from the large amount of a chemical called iron oxide (or ‘rust’ as you might know it) in its rocks and soil.</li>
                   <li class="color">It can get pretty cold on Mars –– much colder than our own planet, since it’s further away from the sun.</li>
                   <li>Mars is home to the highest mountain in our solar system –– a volcano called Olympus Mons. Standing a whopping 24 kilometres high, it’s about three times the height of Mount Everest!</li>
                   <li class="color">You could jump around three times higher on Mars than you can on Earth.</li>
                   <li>Mars has two moons! One is called Phobos and the other Deimos.</li>
                   <li class="color">A day on Mars is 24 hours and 37 minutes –– only a little bit longer than a day on our own planet. A year on Mars, however, is almost twice as long, lasting 687 Earth days! This is because it takes a lot longer than Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun.</li>
                   <li>In 2018, they found evidence of a lake under the planet’s south polar ice cap. Exciting stuff!</li>

                   <h4>jupiter</h4>
                   <li class="color">Jupiter has a total of 79 confirmed moons. It is second only to Saturn when it comes to the total amount of satellites.</li>
                   <li>Jupiter also has 3 ring systems but much smaller than Saturn’s.</li>
                   <li class="color">Jupiter experiences 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.</li>
                   <li>Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky and one of the five visible planets ( Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn ).</li>
                   <li class="color">Jupiter’s mass is almost twice of all the Solar System’s planets combined. It is 318 times more massive than Earth.</li>
                   <li>Though they can be seen only through ultraviolet, Jupiter’s auroras are the brightest in the Solar System.</li>
                   <li class="color">Because Jupiter spins very fast, probably the fastest out of all the planets, it is flattened a bit so it bulges at its equator.</li>
                   <li>Jupiter is surrounded by dangerous waves of radiation, and this makes it hard for spacecraft to approach it.</li>
                   <li class="color">Jupiter shrinks 2 centimeters every year because it radiates too much heat.</li>

                   <li>Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System.</li>
                   <li class="color">Saturn’s nearest moon takes just 12 hours to circle the planet. Its farthest moon takes more than three Earth years.</li>
                   <li>Saturn’s satellites mostly consist of ice</li>
                   <li class="color">When the seasons change, the planet changes its color.</li>
                   <li>Saturn is recognized as the most beautiful planet of the Solar System.</li>
                   <li class="color">The distance from Saturn to Earth is 1.2 billion kilometers (746 million miles).</li>

                   <li>Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of any planet.</li>
                   <li class="color">Uranus is often referred to as an “ice giant” planet.</li>
                   <li>One day on Uranus spans 17 hours and 54 minutes. </li>
                   <li class="color">Uranus is 14.5 times the mass of the Earth.</li>
                   <li>Titania is the largest moon of Uranus. It is about 1/3rd the size of Earth’s moon.</li>
                   <li class="color">Uranus has at-least twenty-seven (27) moons.</li>
                   <li>It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope.</li>
                   <li class="color">The mass of Uranus is about 14.5 times the mass of Earth and 63 Earths can fit inside Uranus.</li>

                   <li>Neptune has 6 faint rings.</li>
                   <li class="color">A year on Neptune lasts 165 Earth years.</li>
                   <li>Light from Neptune reaches us in around 4 hours.</li>
                   <li class="color">Uranus is Neptune’s near twin in size and composition.</li>
                   <li>The core of Neptune is about 1.5 times the size of Earth.</li>
                   <li class="color">Neptune is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System and the smallest of the gas giants.</li>
                   <li>Neptune is Lifeless due to its extreme temperatures and pressures. Neptune cannot support life.</li>
                   <li class="color">Neptune has a total of 6 ring systems surrounding it. Some of them contain ring arcs or clusters of dust particles.</li>
                   <li>Due to its beautiful blue color, Neptune was named after the Roman god of the Sea. In Greek, Neptune is called Poseidon.</li>
